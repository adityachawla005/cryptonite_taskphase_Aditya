# XSS

 Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application.Now if the attacker executes some script they have control over the victim users session and resources.

## Reflected XSS
This occurs when the user input given by an HTTP request is executed and reflected back as a response to the user.

Description:
 This lab contains a simple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search functionality.
To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function. 

My Approach:
in the search box <script>alert(1)</script>

## Reflected XSS
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a website's database .When other users view the affected content, the script is automatically loaded and executed in their browsers. 

Description:
 This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality.
To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the alert function when the blog post is viewed.


My Approach:
In the comment box:
<script>alert(1)</script>
Enter a name, email and website.

## DOM Based XSS

DOM XSS (Document Object Model Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of XSS vulnerability that occurs when a web application’s JavaScript code modifies the content of a web page using untrusted user input. Instead of the server being involved, the malicious payload is executed entirely in the user’s browser

Description:
 This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript document.write function, which writes data out to the page. The document.write function is called with data from location.search, which you can control using the website URL.
To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function. 


My Approach:
When I search for a random string it is put in an img src attribute.
We break out of src attribute by <img src=""><svg onload=alert(1)> and make an svg attribute with alert.
