# Who are you

**Flag:** `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_20ace0e4}`

Approach

- step 1<br>
Modifying the request through BurpSuite to add PicoBrowser to the User-Agent.

```
I don't trust users visiting from another site.
```

- step 2<br>

Adding a Referer Header in the request which is same as the host site
Referer:mercury.picoctf.net:39114/

```
Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
```
- step 3<br>

Spoofing the Date Header in the request with date of 2018
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT

```
I don&#39;t trust users who can be tracked.
```
- step 4<br>
Adding a DNT Header with value 1.
DNT:1

```
This website is only for people from Sweden.
```
- step 5<br>
Spoofing the IP Address X-Forwarded-For: 192.44.242.19 to make the request look like its from Sweden.

```
You&#39;re in Sweden but you don&#39;t speak Swedish?
```
- step 6<br>
Edit the language header to sv-SE,sv;q=0.9.
