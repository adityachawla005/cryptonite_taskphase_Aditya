# Intro to Commands
This level used the concept of invoking commands in order to get the flag

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:

```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.

## Solution

Invoking the hello command.

 ```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MoBtL_wfg9-3rsKWEo2rIREdPYT.ddjNyUDL1kzM2czW}
```
