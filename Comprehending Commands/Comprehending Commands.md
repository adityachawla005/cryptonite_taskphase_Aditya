# Challenge 1-cat:not the pet,but the command!
This level required the use of reading the contents of flag file with cat command.

## Challenge Description
One of the most critical Linux commands is cat. cat is most often used for reading out files, like so:

hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/DESCRIPTION.md
One of the most critical Linux commands is `cat`.
`cat` is most often used for reading out files, like so:

cat will concatenate (hence the name) multiple files if provided multiple arguments. For example:

```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat yourfile
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile myfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
This is my file!
```

Finally, if you give no arguments at all, cat will read from the terminal input and output it. We'll explore that in later challenges...

In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the flag file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with cat!



## Solution

Using the command cat with flag to read its contents in the current directory.

 ```bash
Connected!
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{4VQhCrQjskrYC-bzBM0PyXwCOZs.dFzN1QDL1kzM2czW}
